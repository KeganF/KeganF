### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kegan! I'm currently taking a Computer Programmer Analyst program in college where I'm learning a variety of different programming languages. I'm always eager to learn how I can grow and improve as a developer!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and (most recently) Node.JS. I'm also working on my Java skills (Chess game in the works)!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.JS, Java, and VB.NET.
- ðŸš€ My future learning goals include C#, Python, PHP, and Ruby.
