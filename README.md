### Hi there 👋

I'm Kegan! I'm currently taking a Computer Programmer Analyst program in college where I'm learning a variety of different programming languages. I'm always eager to learn how I can grow and improve as a developer!

I'm also a part time Programmer Analyst while I finish my last year of school.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on web projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and (most recently) Node.JS. I'm also working on my Java skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.JS, JavaScript, Java, and VB.NET.
- 🚀 My future learning goals include C#, Python, PHP, and Ruby.
